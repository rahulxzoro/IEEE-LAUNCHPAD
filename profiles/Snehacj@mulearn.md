| **Parkinson disease detection**  | A machine learning project predicted Parkinson's disease using vocal feature data. Several models were tested, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and Gaussian NB. The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy at 92%, outperforming other models, making it the most effective for this task.                                              |   - | [Repo Link 1](https://github.com/Snehacj/Parkinsons-Disease-Detection--Final-Project)             |
| **Sign Language Recognition**  | The project harnesses Flask framework for web development, offering real-time sign language translation through webcam input. It empowers users by providing accessible communication tools, fostering inclusivity for the hearing impaired. Through efficient integration of sign language recognition, it facilitates seamless interaction via web-based platforms.                                              |    -  |      -   |
