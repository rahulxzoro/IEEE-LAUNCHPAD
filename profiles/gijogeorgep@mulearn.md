| Traffic sign recognition and road safety  |In today’s dynamic road environments, ensuring driver safety remains a critical concern. This project presents an integrated system aimed at enhancing road safety through the simultaneous recognition of traffic signs and detection of driver drowsiness. Leverag- ing advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system achieves accurate and real-time recognition of various traffic signs, including speed lim- its, stop signs, and yield signs. By providing timely alerts and feedback to the driver, the system enhances situational awareness, promoting compliance with traffic regulations and reducing the risk of accidents. Additionally, the project incorporates a robust drowsi- ness detection mechanism that analyzes the driver’s facial expressions, eye movements, and other physiological indicators to identify signs of fatigue or drowsiness. Through proactive intervention, such as alerts and prompts for rest breaks, the system mitigates the dangers associated with driver drowsiness, further enhancing road safety.                                         | in progress   |           |
                                                          

#### Leadership and Influence:

- I led a project team that developed an AI-powered traffic sign recognition system. From the initial concept to the final deployment, you guided the project’s direction, ensuring that the team stayed focused on the objectives of enhancing road safety
- During the development phase, the team encountered a significant challenge with the model’s accuracy in low-light conditions. As a leader, you facilitated brainstorming sessions, encouraged innovative thinking, and decided to incorporate additional pre-processing steps and data augmentation techniques.
- I analyzed the problem, gathered inputs from team members, evaluated potential solutions, and made a data-driven decision that improved the model's performance.

#### Networking:

- Communication: Ability to articulate ideas clearly and concisely to diverse audiences, including technical and non-technical stakeholders

- Relationship Building: Working effectively with team members, partners, and stakeholders to achieve common goals.
  
- Trust Building: Establishing trust through transparency, reliability, and ethical conduct.
  
- Active Listening: Ensuring that I understand the needs, concerns, and feedback from all parties involved.

#### Career Plan:

- Local Workshops and Meetups: Organize workshops and meetups to showcase my traffic sign recognition project, demonstrating its potential impact on road safety. Collaborate with Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) to reach a wider audience.
- Startup Events: Participate in local startup events such as Huddle Kerala and Seeding Kerala to network with other startups, investors, and mentors.
- Road Safety Campaigns: Partner with the Kerala Road Safety Authority to run awareness campaigns highlighting the importance of traffic sign recognition in reducing accidents.
- Startup Clusters: Promote the formation of startup clusters focusing on transportation and safety technologies, facilitating knowledge exchange and collaboration.
-Interdisciplinary Projects: Encourage interdisciplinary projects that bring together experts from different fields (e.g., engineering, urban planning, and policy) to address road safety comprehensively.
- International Partnerships: Forge partnerships with international startups, research institutions, and corporations to bring global best practices and technologies to Kerala. 

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala's tech ecosystem is rapidly evolving, driven by strong government initiatives, a solid educational foundation, and a vibrant startup culture. The Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) plays a crucial role, offering funding, infrastructure, mentorship, and networking opportunities. The state government supports this growth with startup-friendly policies, tax incentives, and grants.

- Kerala boasts a high literacy rate and is home to prestigious institutions like IIT Palakkad and IIM Kozhikode, which produce skilled graduates. Numerous engineering colleges further ensure a continuous supply of tech talent. The startup scene in Kerala is thriving, with many successful ventures in technology, healthcare, and tourism. Regular events like Huddle Kerala and Seeding Kerala foster a culture of innovation and collaboration among entrepreneurs, investors, and experts.



#### History of Community Engagement:

- In my opinion, community engagement in a technical capacity has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my journey in the tech world. Over the years, I have actively participated in various platforms and forums, sharing knowledge and learning from others.

- On Stack Overflow, I've spent considerable time answering questions, particularly in areas related to machine learning, computer vision, and programming languages. This not only helped others solve their problems but also deepened my own understanding of these subjects. Contributing to this platform has been an excellent way to give back to the community and stay updated with the latest challenges and trends in the industry.

- I've also been involved in technical forums and mailing lists related to specific technologies and projects I'm passionate about. For instance, I've participated in discussions on TensorFlow and OpenCV mailing lists, where I engaged with both beginners and experts to troubleshoot issues, share best practices, and discuss new developments. These interactions have been invaluable for networking and staying informed about advancements in the field.

- Furthermore, I've been active on Discord servers dedicated to technology and programming. These real-time discussions are particularly useful for quick troubleshooting and brainstorming sessions. Whether it's providing code reviews, suggesting resources, or collaborating on open-source projects, these engagements have allowed me to connect with a global community of like-minded individuals.
