| **Integrating GAN-Based Image Inpainting with Object Recognition and Emotion
Detection for Enhanced Visual Understanding**  | developed an advanced image inpainting system using GANs,
integrated it with pretrained YOLOv3 for object detection and VGG16 for emotion
detection, and created a flask-based web app for users to upload and process
images. Utilising OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras, we achieved efficient and
accurate results                                              | [Hosted Link 1](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 1](https://github.com/username/project1)             |
| **Fee management system**  | mini-project on a fee management
system for a college using Python Django. The fee management system provides
a user-friendly interface for students to access their tuition fee details. It allows
them to view payment deadlines, generate payment receipts, and receive
notifications regarding upcoming tuition fee schedules                                              | [Hosted Link 2](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 2](https://github.com/username/project2)             |
