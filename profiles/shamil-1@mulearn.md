| **Indian sign language detection using images**  | The project focused on live Indian Sign Language detection and comparing CNN models (ConvNeXtSmall and DenseNet121) in this context, Using Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Pandas, data visualization libraries and etc. The main challenge was the lack of standard datasets for Indian Sign Language. To address this, I manually constructed a dataset for training the models.    |   |  https://github.com/iknoul/Indian-sign-language-detection-using-images- |
