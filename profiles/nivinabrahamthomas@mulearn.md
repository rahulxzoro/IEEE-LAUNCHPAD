### About Me

> I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Saintgits College of Engineering, Kottayam. Passionate about technology and problem-solving, I've developed skills in Java, Python, C, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Django, React, and SQL. I'm also enthusiastic about AI and continually expand my knowledge in this field. Currently, I'm doing a full stack development course in Python.
Open to new opportunities and collaborations, I'm eager to apply my skills and learn more in the ever-evolving tech world. Let's connect and explore how we can innovate together.
