## Portfolio Highlights

### My Projects

| Name                | Description                                                               |

| Road Driving Simulator'24 | Road Driving Simulator'24 or RDS'24 is a Game created using the Unity3D Game Development Software. This was my final year project for my B.Tech degree. The aim of the game is to educate the people on basic road driving procedures and rules to help make them better drivers in actual driving. I was the Lead developer and handled all the scripting of the game in C#.                                      |

#### Leadership and Influence:

- I was the lead Coordinator of the Placement Cell of College of Engineering Kallooppara. As the lead I managed all the major placement cell drives conducted by companies like UST, Mitsogo along with training for the students among many others.
- I was Lead developer of my Project group of the final year project in our College. As the Lead Developer, I handled most of the scripting, providing assistance to other members scripting along with providing insights to the further development of the project.
- I was the Team Lead of Team LTH, one of the top 20 teams in ICT Academy's Techathlon Event in 2022. As the Lead, I spearheaded the progress of the Team in developing solutions to the problem statements provided. We were the first team from our College to make Top 20.

#### Networking:

- I try my very best to be outgoing and social and I am a very good Team player. As the Placement Cell Coordinator of my College I got to network with various professionals and individuals, giving me unique insights into the field of Computer Science. I have also attended various Hackathons, Webinars and Meets, all of which helped me form a good Network of individuals. This is also what I plan to do ahead.

#### Career Plan:

- My current plan is to get a lay of the land when it comes to the field of Computer Science as a fresher. I want to hone my skills in the field and gain a deeper understanding of the environment. Over time I want to provide solutions towards improving the Education aspect of the Country through the use of Software, making it more intereactive and fun for Students to learn.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala shows enormous potential for Technical Excellence through providing Startups a lot of assistance and providing a lot of support for Technical Parks like Infopark. However, most of the youth seem to want to pursue and live outside the country. I think with enough effort and optimism, Kerala could be the next Dubai or Silicon Valley.
