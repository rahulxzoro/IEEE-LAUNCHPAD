| **IoT based air pollution monitoring system**  |An IoT-based air pollution monitoring system using Node MCU (ESP8266) involves deploying a network of sensors for measuring pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, CO, O3, SO2, and NO2. The Node MCU collects data from these sensors and transmits it via Wi-Fi to a cloud platform such as AWS IoT or Azure IoT Hub for storage and analysis. Users access real-time and historical air quality data through a web or mobile interface, featuring visualizations like charts and maps. The system can issue alerts when pollution levels exceed set thresholds, aiding in timely intervention and public awareness. Regular sensor maintenance and calibration ensure data accuracy, supporting efforts in environmental monitoring and health management.                                            | [Repo Link 1](https://github.com/minhaj-v-s/Safelink)             |
| **Organic Food Traceability using Blockchain**  |Organic Food Traceability using Blockchain aims to enhance transparency and trust in the food supply chain by leveraging blockchain technology. Each stage of the organic food production, processing, and distribution—from farm to table—is recorded as immutable blocks on a blockchain. This includes details such as farming practices, certifications, inspections, transportation, and storage conditions. Consumers can scan QR codes on product packaging to access this decentralized ledger, verifying the authenticity of organic claims and ensuring adherence to organic standards. Blockchain ensures data integrity, reducing fraud and enhancing accountability across the entire organic food ecosystem, ultimately promoting consumer confidence in organic products.                                            | [Repo Link 1](https://github.com/minhaj-v-s/Safelink)             |
