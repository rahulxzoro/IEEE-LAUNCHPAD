Proficient in web development (HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL), MERN stack, Python, and C, I've led projects recognized both academically and professionally. Notably, I was part of the team ranked among the top 30 in the WOW Hackathon, a prestigious competition by Google Developer Student Clubs as part of GDSC WOW Kerala 2023.

In addition to my technical skills, I'm well-versed in tools such as Canva, Figma, and GitHub, leveraging them to enhance collaboration and streamline workflows. My knack for multitasking, problem-solving, and fostering collaboration ensures successful outcomes in every endeavor.
