| **Flood-Guard: Real-Time Flood Monitoring and Alert System Using IoT**  |  ”Flood-Guard” represents a groundbreaking advancement in flood safety and risk mitigation, epitomizing our unwavering commitment to utilizing technology for disaster prevention and bolstering community resilience. At the core of this innovative project is a proactive monitoring and alerting system that serves as a guardian for critical infrastructure and the well-being of nearby populations. Our proposed model harnesses the power of a strategically deployed network of IoT sensors across flood-prone areas, including rivers, streams, and urban drainage systems. These sensors tirelessly gather data on water levels, rainfall, weather conditions, and other pertinent environmental parameters. The collected information is seamlessly transmitted wirelessly to a centralized control system, where it undergoes real-time processing and analysis. This robust infrastructure empowers authorities with timely and accurate insights, enabling swift response actions to mitigate the impact of potential floods, ultimately safeguarding lives and securing vital infrastructure.| [Hosted Link 1](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 1](https://github.com/username/project1)             |
| **Kudumbashree Management System**  | Most of the kudumbashree units record their weekly collection details in papers or in a book. It is very hard to store those papers safely. If one of the papers is missing, the entire data of that unit will be lost. In such a situation, this research objective is to find out the solution of storing the weekly data in a safe platform to prevent the hard situations. With the help of this system, the admin can easily enter the cash collection records weekly through the system, also the other members can see their deposit details. And also, every member can easily request for loans without following the paperwork. A computer-based management system is designed to handle all the primary information required to calculate weekly statements of member’s account which include the weekly statement of any month. In this system, we used the waterfall model. This project intends to introduce more user-friendliness in the various activities such as record updation, maintenance, and searching. The search of records has been made quite simple as all the details of the member can be obtained by simply keying in the identification or account number of that member.                                              | [Hosted Link 2](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 2](https://github.com/username/project2)             |
