| **WIRELESS ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGER**  | A wireless electric vehicle charger utilizes electromagnetic induction to transfer energy from a charging pad on the ground to a receiver pad installed on the vehicle. This technology enables EVs to recharge without the need for physical cables, providing convenience and reducing wear on connectors. It automates the charging process when the vehicle is parked correctly over the charging pad, enhancing user experience and promoting the adoption of electric vehicles in residential, commercial, and public settings. However, wireless chargers may have slightly lower efficiency compared to traditional plug-in methods due to energy losses in the electromagnetic field transfer.                                              | [Hosted Link 1](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 1](https://github.com/username/project1)             |
