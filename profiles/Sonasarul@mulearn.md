#### Leadership and Influence:
During my four years at the Academy, I had a significant leadership career, serving as the treasurer of our college's IEEE student branch and as the editor of the Vidhyuth Electrical and Electronics Department Association. As treasurer of IEEE, I managed financial operations, ensuring the smooth execution of our events and programs. Additionally, I played a crucial role in organizing and conducting numerous programs and events under both IEEE SB and the Vidhyuth association. These experiences not only enhanced my leadership capabilities but also taught me the importance of collaboration, planning, and effective communication in achieving organizational goals.
