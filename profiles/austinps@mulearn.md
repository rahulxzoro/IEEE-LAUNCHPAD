#### Leadership and Influence:

* Lead a team of three and won an Ideathon. Came up with a solution to conserve water in irrigation.
* I directed the building of a functional automated greenhouse model, leading a team to turn the concept into reality. It used an Arduino Uno microcontroller
  to operate a self sufficient, closed loop greenhouse environment.
* Organized several college programs and events.

#### Networking:

I have participated in several tech fests and competitions, and formed connections with likeminded people.

#### Career Plan:

I want to learn new skills and help others in their software development path.  
In the long term, I would like to work in a company where I can showcase my skills and make meaningful contributions to their growth.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala is full of young and capable developers and all they need is good quality mentorship and a push in the right direction. 
I believe communities like Mulearn is a great way of giveing these devs opportunities to get together and learn new skills and will help thousands, inlcuding me.

#### History of Community Engagement:

I am an active member of the Mulearn discord community.
