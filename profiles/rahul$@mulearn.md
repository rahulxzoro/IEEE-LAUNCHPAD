| **Emotion Detection of Autistic Children**  | With a worthy cause of utilising a state-of-the-art CNN model to identify the emotions of autistic children and promptly notify them when they feel cornered, we built an app. With Firebase Authentication assuring a safe signup and login process, I contributed by building the solid backend architecture. We transferred the photographs to Firebase Storage in a fluid manner to capture the children's facial expressions with care. Our sophisticated CNN model then assumed control and accurately analysed and recognised their emotions. We were able to provide timely assistance to children when they needed it most because of our considerate approach, which highlights our commitment to their comfort and well-being. | [Hosted Link 1]    | [Repo Link 1]           |
| **Store App**                               | We have developed a simplified system with an account and student data portal for store managers. With the use of a bar code scanner, this creative application streamlines the process of obtaining student information through admission number search. By subtracting the necessary purchase amount, it additionally makes transactions more seamless. Additionally, our programme allows for concurrent use, guaranteeing storekeepers smooth operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [Hosted Link 2]    | [Repo Link 2]           |

#### Leadership and Influence:

- I was the lead for a large project in college that used Dart for backend development, making sure that the frontend components integrated perfectly. In order to promote teamwork and advance our web development talents, I mentored peers on Dart's features. I was able to influence technical decisions that improved project performance and scalability by promoting Dart's effectiveness. I expanded my influence in the developer community and gained insightful knowledge by working on open-source Dart projects outside of class. These experiences equipped me for software engineering responsibilities and strengthened my leadership in backend development.

#### Networking:

- By actively participating in business events and online forums, cultivating relationships, and keeping abreast of trends, I excel at networking. I'll participate in open-source projects, attend local events, and keep up an online presence to network and exchange ideas with people across the world.My strategy for leadership involves providing peer mentorship, promoting optimal software development techniques, and disseminating thought leadership via presentations and writings. My goal is to leave a significant mark on the software development community by encouraging teamwork and creativity.

#### Career Plan:

- I want to actively participate in the startup scene in Kerala in the near future by going to events and working with them on technical initiatives. I'll provide early-stage entrepreneurs with mentoring, with an emphasis on market strategy and product development.
