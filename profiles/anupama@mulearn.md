### About Me

> 
I'm Anupama, a fresher who completed B.Tech from KMEA Engineering College. I'm interested in machine learning and AI, and I have done classification and segmentation projects. Iâ€™ve built projects using boards like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Jetson Nano, and I'm also interested in embedded systems. My goals are to deepen my expertise in machine learning and AI, and to work on innovative embedded systems projects. I continuously participate and learn from every opportunity to achieve these goals.

| **Focal Cortical Dysplasia Detection**  | This condition of FCD is mainly find in epileptic chilren and they are meant to have small lesions on their brain may cause seizure at time. Thses lesions are so difficult to be detected. So this projects comes up with the idea of segmenting the lesion area if the abnormal cortical thickness is detected. The segmentation is performed using a Unet architecture and the classification is done using 3D CNN architecture.                                           | https://github.com/anugrt/FCD_segmentation_Classification          |
| **Attendance Monitoring**  | This project utilizes Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Haar Cascades for attendance monitoring. It employs computer vision techniques to detect faces, recognize them using LBP, and track attendance.                                           |  https://github.com/anugrt/Attendance_monitoring_using_LBPHandHAAR            |
