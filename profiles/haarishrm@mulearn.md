- Software tools i used was mainly VS code and Pycharm. In that for Backend works and database connections i used Pycharm and to do frontend works iam using VS code which is most familiar and easy-one. We can use backend work and connections in VS code itself but the good approach is for backend is Pycharm for especially Django and other frame work of python pycharm is the recommed one. And github is the another traineer form me where i reffer the coding.
