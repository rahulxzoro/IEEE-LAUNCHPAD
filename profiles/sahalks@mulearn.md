| **HEART DISEASE PREDICTION USING ECG IMAGES AND COMMON PHYSICAL EXAMINATION INDICATORS**  | This study enhances heart failure detection using AI, combining machine learning and deep learning. The machine learning model employs the Random Forest algorithm to predict heart disease with at least 90% accuracy based on health parameters like age, gender, blood pressure, and ECG results. For ECG image analysis, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) diagnoses conditions using a dataset from Kaggle, classifying results into categories such as Fibrillation, Myocardial Infarction, and Normal. This approach aims to improve early detection and accurate diagnosis of heart conditions.                                            | [Repo Link 1]()             |
