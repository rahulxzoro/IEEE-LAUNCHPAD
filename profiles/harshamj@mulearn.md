| **Experimental Investigation on Strength Analysis of Foam concrete to develop building blocks.**  | In which we analysed mechanical properties, density and water absorption of foam concrete by replacing

cement with flyash and silicafume.                                            | [Hosted Link 1](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 1](https://github.com/username/project1)             |
| **Planning and Estimation of a vetinary Hospital**  | Prepared detailed drawings through AutoCad. We  used MS excel for preparation of estimate through it made

feel professional. We used MS word for preparing the project report.                                           | [Hosted Link 2](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 2](https://github.com/username/project2)             |

#### Leadership and Influence:

- I have won NCC C Certificate and was project team leader.
- I am IEDC Volunteer and coordinated Vistle summit conducted at VAST Thrissur.volunteered blood donation camps.

#### Networking:

- Iam in IEDC community connect and propogate ideas.

#### Career Plan:

- I would like to join a reputed organisation and work for its development and thus I can also develop my skills. Then  I will analyse the problem in system and workhard to find solution.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- By conducting science exhibitions and skill competitions to expose the ideas among people. By group or by individually as their preference.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:
 The history of open source contributions dates back to the 1950s and 1960s, when software development was a collaborative effort among academics and researchers. Here's a brief overview:

- 1950s-1960s: Early software sharing and collaboration among computer scientists and researchers.
- 1970s-1980s: Emergence of Unix and its variants, with source code freely available for modification and distribution.
- 1983: Richard Stallman launches the GNU Project, aiming to create a free operating system.
- 1985: Stallman establishes the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to promote free software principles.
- 1991: Linus Torvalds creates Linux, a free and open-source operating system.
- 1998: The Open Source Initiative (OSI) is founded, popularizing the term "open source."
- 2000s: Open source gains mainstream recognition, with projects like Apache, MySQL, and Firefox achieving widespread adoption.
- Present day: Open source is ubiquitous, with millions of contributors and users worldwide, and its principles influencing other areas like hardware, data, and culture.

Some notable milestones and contributors include:

- Richard Stallman (GNU, FSF)
- Linus Torvalds (Linux)
- Tim O'Reilly (OSI, advocacy)
- Eric Raymond (The Cathedral and the Bazaar)
- Bruce Perens (OSI, Debian)
- Larry Wall (Perl)

This is just a brief summary, but I hope it gives you a sense of the rich history behind open source contributions!
