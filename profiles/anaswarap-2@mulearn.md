# ANASWARA P

### About Me
Computer Science and Engineering graduate with a strong passion for coding and development. I have done a course on embedded system from Vector, Bangalore, where I acquired practical skills in C, C++, Embedded C, DSA, Communication Protocols and stimulation tools like  Proteus and Keil. During my internship, I contributed to real-world projects and learned directly from industry professionals, enhancing my hands-on experience.

| **Data Acquisition System**  | This project was implemented using UART, SPI and 12C protocols. The system measures the real-time value of pressure, temperature and and light intensity of the atmosphere and displays it on the screen. The microcontroller communicates with each sensor to acquire data. Each sensor sends the measured values (pressure, temperature, light intensity) back to the microcontroller using their respective communication protocols. The microcontroller processes the received data. This might include filtering, averaging, and converting raw sensor data into meaningful values. And the values are displaced on the screen. | [Hosted Link 2]    | [Repo Link 2](https://github.com/Anaswaraaa/easy_go_app)          |
| **Easy Go: Bus pass using QRCode scanner**  | The Android software is designed to enhance the efficiency of the bus ticketing procedure by generating unique QR codes for each registered passenger. These QR codes act as virtual bus passes, eliminating the need for physical paper tickets and enabling quick and easy ticket verification. Passengers register via the Android application by providing necessary details such as name, contact information, and travel preferences. The application securely stores this information in a database. The software generates a unique QR code for each passenger.     |  [Hosted Link 2]|    [Repo Link 2](https://github.com/Anaswaraaa/Data-Acquisition-System)


#### Networking
To learn, work together, and exchange ideas, I use my networking abilities to connect with others in my profession. Through volunteering, attending events, and joining forums, I want to get involved with the communities. I want to help and inspire people by imparting my wisdom and experiences. Key components of my strategy to have a good influence in my area include fostering relationships and assisting others in succeeding.


#### Career Plan:
Immediate plan is to secure a position in embedded systems or technology.
In the longer term, I aim to contribute to the Kerala Startup Ecosystem by mentoring young entrepreneurs, participating in tech incubators, and helping to create a vibrant community for startups. I envision fostering an environment where creativity and innovation thrive, making Kerala a hub for tech startups.


#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala has the potential to excel in the technological startup ecosystem by developing the skills of its people, encouraging creativity, and providing a welcoming atmosphere for new businesses.  By focusing on creating more incubators, providing funding opportunities, and encouraging collaboration between academia and industry, Kerala can become a leading technology hub. Emphasizing sustainable and inclusive growth will also ensure that the benefits of technology reach all sections of society.
