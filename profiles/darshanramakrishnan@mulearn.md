| **1.	Vehicle Status Checking and Mechanic Notification Application**  | It is an cutting edge mobile application designed to provide a convenient and efficient way for users to monitor the current status of their vehicles and promptly notify mechanics when maintenance or repairs are needed.                                              | [Hosted Link 1](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 1](https://github.com/username/project1)             |
| **2.	Intelligent Traffic Management System**  | It is innovative system developed and implemented using YOLOv3 object detection, COCO(Common Objects in Context) dataset and advanced image processing capabilities to accurately evaluate traffic density.                                               | [Hosted Link 2](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 2](https://github.com/username/project2)             |

#### Leadership and Influence:

- I can act as central information hub, summarizing research and documentation on Intelligent Traffic Management System. I can analyze large datasets to identify potential relationships between status of traffic conditions and vehicle counts. This can help me find new research directions and innovative models.

#### Networking:

- Explain your networking skills and how you plan to engage with the communitys. Outline how you will influence and lead others in your respective field. 

#### Career Plan:

- My career goals include creating educational content on social media and highlighting success stories. I am enthusiastic about summarizing diverse topics like movies, games, news, current affairs, web design, and programming for others. I aim to leverage my soft skills, problem-solving abilities, and strong programming skills to propel innovative organizations forward in the role of a Software Engineer.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Integrating startup workshops and mentorship programs into universities and colleges helps foster entrepreneurship, provides practical experience, and equips students with essential skills and networks to succeed in their future careers.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- Many people use open-source software every day without realizing it, and some contribute in ways that don’t involve coding. Contributions such as researching ideas, reporting bugs, and writing documentation help ensure that open-source software remains accessible, useful, and continually improving for everyone.

#### History of Community Engagement:

-  I could receive training using a vast dataset of questions and answers gathered from technical forums and mentorship programs. This training would enable me to recognize common issues, propose possible solutions, and guide users to existing community resources effectively.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- Highlight any highly visible technical blog posts, articles, or video series you have created.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- If you've developed software tools that are widely used by users (not just contributors), mention them.

#### Competitive Website Profiles:

- I often use LeetCode to solve programming questions.
