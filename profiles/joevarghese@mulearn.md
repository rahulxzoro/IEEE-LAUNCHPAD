Leadership and Influence:
I believe I meet the requirements for being a leader or influencer in my domain due to my experience in leading projects and coordinating team efforts effectively. During my final year of B.Tech in 
Computer Science & Engineering at Sahrdaya College of Engineering and Technology, I took on the role of project leader for our group. The project idea was mine. As the leader, I was responsible for dividing the workload 
among team members, ensuring everyone had clear tasks, and coordinating the project to meet our deadlines and objectives. This experience honed my skills in project management, delegation, and team coordination.

Additionally, I have led multiple volunteering activities at my college. In these roles, I organized events, coordinated volunteers, and ensured successful execution of activities. For example, I was a key leader in
various events under the Computer Society of India and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. These experiences have strengthened my leadership and influencing skills, enabling me to motivate and guide 
teams towards achieving common goals.

My ability to lead projects, coupled with my active involvement in volunteering activities, demonstrates my capability to be an effective leader and influencer in my domain.
Networking:
I have developed strong networking skills through active participation in various academic and extracurricular activities. My involvement in the Computer Society of India and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers has provided me with numerous opportunities to connect with professionals and peers in my field. I have also attended multiple hackathons and workshops, where I engaged with participants and industry experts, 
expanding my professional network and staying updated with the latest trends and technologies.

To engage with the community, I plan to leverage online platforms like LinkedIn and GitHub to showcase my work and connect with like-minded professionals. By sharing my projects, participating in discussions, 
and contributing to open-source initiatives, I aim to build a robust online presence. Additionally, I will attend conferences, webinars, and meetups to interact with experts and stay informed about industry developments.
