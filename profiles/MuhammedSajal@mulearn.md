My ultimate goal is to leverage innovation for meaningful societal solutions, fostering a fulfilling career in the process.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has great potential to excel in tech startups. With many skilled graduates, like myself with a BTech in Computer Science, the state can support innovation through more tech hubs and parks. Government incentives, mentorship programs, and improved digital infrastructure are key. My projects, like the FOSSFOLIO event app and LEXISCAN dyslexia tool, show what's possible. Promoting events like hackathons and tech conferences will further boost Kerala's startup ecosystem.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- Eager to contribute to open-source, I value its collaborative spirit and role in innovation. I plan to engage with projects aligning with my skills, offering code contributions, bug reports, or discussion participation. This will enhance my expertise while giving back to the community that fosters my growth.

#### History of Community Engagement:

-  I served as Regional Coordinator for the Energy Cell in NSS Ernakulam (2022-2023), promoting sustainable energy practices. I attended the Amazon ML Summer School in 2023, collaborating with peers and experts in machine learning. My projects, like FOSSFOLIO (an event management app) and LEXISCAN (a dyslexia detection tool), demonstrate my commitment to using technology for societal benefit. These experiences highlight my active community engagement and the positive impact of technology.
